# SplashScreenAPI33

This project is created SplashScreen with latest Android features. We also managed Dark and Linght mode.


Important: If you implemented a custom splash screen in Android 11 or lower,
migrate your app to the SplashScreen API to ensure it displays correctly in Android 12 and higher.
For instructions, see Migrate your existing splash screen implementation to Android 12.
